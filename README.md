CS202 Projects
This repository contains a collection of C programming projects completed in the CS202 course. It includes executable code along with data files related to the projects.

Contents:
Executable Code: A set of C programs developed as part of course assignments.

Data Files: Files required by the programs for data processing or testing.

File Descriptions:<br>
hello_world.c: 
A simple Hello World program to familiarize with the C programming language. It prints a message to the screen.

loan_calculator.c: 
A program that calculates the first month's interest for a loan. It takes input for the loan amount, interest rate, and desired monthly payment, then checks if the loan can be repaid at the given monthly payment. The program also calculates and displays the first monthâ€™s interest based on the loan and interest rate.

statistics_calculator.c: 
This program calculates the mean and standard deviation of a fixed list of numbers. It defines functions for calculating the mean, standard deviation, and printing the list of numbers. The user does not need to input data as the numbers are predefined in the code.

dynamic_statistics_calculator.c: 
An improved version of the previous program that allows the user to input a list of numbers (up to 20). It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the input numbers, providing a dynamic way to compute statistics from user input.

caesar_cipher.c: 
A data encryption program using the Caesar Cipher technique. It encrypts and decrypts text based on a specified key value. The program preserves the case of the letters (uppercase or lowercase) during encryption and decryption.

contact_management.c: 
A contact management system that allows users to add, display, search for, and delete contacts. It ensures no duplicate contacts are added by checking existing names before adding new ones. The program dynamically manages the memory allocation for contacts.

order_report.c: 
A program that reads order data from a file (orders.txt) and displays reports. It includes functions to display individual order reports and product-based reports showing the subtotals for each order and each product, respectively. The data includes order IDs, product IDs, quantities, and prices.
